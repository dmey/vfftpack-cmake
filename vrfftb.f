C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Subroutine VRFFTB computes the synthesis (backward transform) of a
C  number of real periodic sequences from their Fourier coefficients. 
C  Specifically, for each set of independent Fourier coefficients
C  F(K), the corresponding real periodic sequence is computed. 
C
C  The array WSAVE which is used by subroutine VRFFTB must be
C  initialized by calling subroutine VRFFTI(N,WSAVE).
C
C
C  Input Parameters
C
C  M       the number of sets of coefficients.
C
C  N       the length of the sequences of coefficients to be 
C          transformed.  The method is most efficient when N is a
C          product of small primes, however n may be any positive 
C          integer.
C
C  R       areal two-dimensional array of size MDIMX x N containing the
C          coefficients to be transformed.  Each set of coefficients
C          F(K), K\0,1,..,N-1, is stored as a ROW of R.  Specifically,
C          the I-th set of independent Fourier coefficients is stored
C
C                R(I,1) = REAL( F(I,0) ),
C
C                R(I,2*K) = REAL( F(I,K) )
C
C                R(I,2*K+1) = IMAG( F(I,K) )
C
C                   for K = 1, 2, . . . , M-1,
C
C                and, when N is even,
C
C                R(I,N) = REAL( F(I,N/2) ).
C
C  RT      a real two-dimensional work array of size MDIMX x N.
C
C  MDIMR   the row (or first) dimension of the arrays R and RT exactly 
C          as they appear in the calling program.  This parameter is 
C          used to specify the variable dimension of these arrays.
C
C  WSAVE   a real one-dimensional work array which must be dimensioned
C          at least N+15.  The WSAVE array must be initialized by 
C          calling subroutine VRFFTI.  A different WSAVE array must be
C          used for each different value of N.  This initialization does
C          not have to be repeated so long as N remains unchanged.  The
C          same WSAVE array may be used by VRFFTB and VRFFTB.
C
C  Output Parameters
C
C  R       contains M real periodic sequences corresponding to the given
C          coefficients.  Specifically, the I-th row of R contains the 
C          real periodic sequence corresponding to the I-th set of
C          independent Fourier coefficients F(I,K) stored as
C
C               R(I,J) = X(I,J-1) ,   J = 1, 2, . . . , N, where
C
C               X(I,J) = SQRT(1/N)* F(I,0) + (-1)**J*F(I,N/2)
C                        + 2*SUM(K=1,M)[ REAL(F(I,2K))*COS(2K*J*PI/N)
C                        - IMAG(F(I,2K+1))*SIN(2K*J*PI/N) ]  ,
C
C                 when N is even, and
C
C               X(I,J) = SQRT(1/N)* F(I,0) +
C                        2*SUM(K=1,M)[ REAL(F(I,2K))*COS(2K*J*PI/N)
C                        - IMAG(F(I,2K+1))*SIN(2K*J*PI/N) ]  ,
C
C                 when N is odd.
C
C  WSAVE   contains results which must not be destroyed between calls
C          to VRFFTF or VRFFTB.
C
C  -----------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  NOTE  -  A call of VRFFTF followed immediately by a call of
C           of VRFFTB will return the original sequences R.  Thus,
C           VRFFTB is the correctly normalized inverse of VRFFTF.
C
C  -----------------------------------------------------------------
C
C  VRFFTB is a straightforward extension of the subprogram RFFTB to
C  handle M simultaneous sequences.  RFFTB was originally developed
C  by P. N. Swarztrauber of NCAR.
